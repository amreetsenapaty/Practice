Disable intel turbo boost in bios.. you'll be able to play all these games at 1080p low to mid settings on the radeon 530 using driver 18.7.1. Turbo boost will most likely cause thermal throttling thus reducing performance when gaming.?

+Rishabh Adhikari go to bios disable turbo boost...if you can't find the settings in the hp BIOS go to windows control panel.. power options..edit power plan..look for max cpu performance and set it to 99% instead of 100% restart the laptop. Turbo boost will be disabled.?
